## 4.1 NETWORK

- A network is a set of devices (often referred to as nodes) connected by communication links.
- A node can be a computer, printer, or any other device capable of sending and/or receiving data generated by other nodes on the network.
- “Computer network’’ means a collection of autonomous computers interconnected by a single technology.

A data communications system has five components

**Message**. 
- The message is the information (data) to be communicated. 
- Popular forms of information include text, numbers, pictures, audio, and video.

**Sender**. 
- The sender is the device that sends the data message. 
- It can be a computer, workstation, telephone handset, video camera, and so on.

**Receiver**. 
- The receiver is the device that receives the message. 
- It can be a computer, workstation, telephone handset, television, and so on.

**Transmission medium**. 
- The transmission medium is the physical path by which a message travels from sender to receiver. 
- Some examples of transmission media include twisted-pair wire, coaxial cable, fiber-optic cable, and radio waves.

**Protocol**. 
- A protocol is a set of rules that govern data communications. 
- It represents an agreement between the communicating devices. 
- Without a protocol, two devices may be connected but not communicating, just as a person speaking French cannot be understood by a person who speaks only Japanese.

**Data Flow**

Communication between two devices can be simplex, half-duplex, or full-duplex

![[4.1_Modes_of_Communication.png]]

![4.1 Modes of Communication](https://github.com/anilkaraniya/college/blob/main/BCA/sem-1/notes/Computer%20Fundamentals/CF-Assets/4.1_Modes_of_Communication.png?raw=true)

**Simplex**
- In simplex mode, the communication is unidirectional, as on a one- way street. 
- Only one of the two devices on a link can transmit; the other can only receive (Figure a). 
- Keyboards and traditional monitors are examples of simplex devices.

**Half-Duplex**
- In half-duplex mode, each station can both transmit and receive, but not at the same time. 
- When one device is sending, the other can only receive, and vice versa (Figure b). 
- Walkie-talkies and CB (citizens band) radios are both half- duplex systems.

**Full-Duplex**
- In full-duplex, both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously (Figure c). 
- One common example of full-duplex communication is the telephone network. 
- When two people are communicating by a telephone line, both can talk and listen at the same time. 
- The full-duplex mode is used when communication in both directions is required all the time.

**Network Criteria**

A network must be able to meet a certain number of criteria. Which are:- 

**Performance**: 
- Performance can be measured in many ways, including transit time and response time. 
- Transit time is the amount of time required for a message to travel from one device to another. 
- Response time is the elapsed time between an inquiry and a response. 
- The performance of a network depends on a number of factors, including the number of users, the type of transmission medium, the capabilities of the connected hardware, and the efficiency of the software. Performance is often evaluated by two networking metrics: throughput and delay. 
- We often need more throughput and less delay. However, these two criteria are often contradictory. 
- If we try to send more data to the network, we may increase throughput but we increase the delay because of traffic congestion in the network.

**Reliability**: 
- In addition to accuracy of delivery, network reliability is measured by the frequency of failure, the time it takes a link to recover from a failure, and the network's robustness in a catastrophe.

**Security**: 
- Network security issues include protecting data from unauthorized access, protecting data from damage and development, and implementing policies and procedures for recovery from breaches and data losses.

### 4.1.1 NETWORK TERMINOLOGY

1. **Nodes** – Any device connected to the network.
2. **Links** – Communication path between any 2 nodes.
3. **Connectivity** – Data connection follows 3 defined phases – Connection is established between 2 nodes, Data transferred between 2 nodes, Connection released between nodes.
4. **Switching** – Important technique for data transfer in WAN.
	- Circuit Switching
	- Message Switching
	- Packet Switching

### 4.1.2 TOPOLOGIES

#### 4.1.2.1 Linear Topology

- As the name suggests, the point-to-point is a network topology with a dedicated link between two endpoints.
- The bus topology is designed in such a way that all the stations are connected through a single cable known as a backbone cable.
- When a node wants to send a message over the network, it puts a message over the network. All the stations available in the network will receive the message whether it has been addressed or not.

**Advantages of bus topology**

- **Low-cost cable:** In bus topology, nodes are directly connected to the cable without passing through a hub. Therefore, the initial cost of installation is low.
- **Moderate data speeds:** Coaxial or twisted pair cables are mainly used in bus-based networks that support upto 10 Mbps.
- **Familiar technology:** Bus topology is a familiar technology as the installation and troubleshooting techniques are well known, and hardware components are easily available.
- **Limited failure:** A failure in one node will not have any effect on other nodes.

![[4.2_Linear_Topology.png]]

![4.2 Linear Topology](https://github.com/anilkaraniya/college/blob/main/BCA/sem-1/notes/Computer%20Fundamentals/CF-Assets/4.2_Linear_Topology.png?raw=true)

**Disadvantages of bus topology**

-   **Extensive cabling:** A bus topology is quite simpler, but still it requires a lot of cabling.
-   **Difficult troubleshooting:** It requires specialized test equipment to determine the cable faults. If any fault occurs in the cable, then it would disrupt the communication for all the nodes.
-   **Signal interference:** If two nodes send the messages simultaneously, then the signals of both the nodes collide with each other.
-   **Reconfiguration difficult:** Adding new devices to the network would slow down the network.
-   **Attenuation:** Attenuation is a loss of signal leads to communication issues. Repeaters are used to regenerate the signal.

#### 4.1.2.2 Star Topology

-   Star topology is an arrangement of the network in which every node is connected to the central hub, switch or a central computer.
-   The central computer is known as a **server**, and the peripheral devices attached to the server are known as **clients**.
-   Coaxial cable or RJ-45 cables are used to connect the computers.
-   Hubs or Switches are mainly used as connection devices in a physical star topology.
-   Star topology is the most popular topology in network implementation.

 ![[4.3_Star_Topology.png]]

![4.3 Star Topology](https://github.com/anilkaraniya/college/blob/main/BCA/sem-1/notes/Computer%20Fundamentals/CF-Assets/4.3_Star_Topology.png?raw=true)

**Advantages of star topology**

-   **Efficient troubleshooting:**  In a star topology, all the stations are connected to the centralized network. Therefore, the network administrator has to go to the single station to troubleshoot the problem.
-   **Network control:** Complex network control features can be easily implemented in the star topology. Any changes made in the star topology are automatically accommodated.
-   **Limited failure:** As each station is connected to the central hub with its own cable, therefore failure in one cable will not affect the entire network.
-   **Familiar technology:** Star topology is a familiar technology as its tools are cost-effective.
-   **Easily expandable:** It is easily expandable as new stations can be added to the open ports on the hub.
-   **Cost effective:** Star topology networks are cost-effective as it uses inexpensive coaxial cable.
-   **High data speeds:** It supports a bandwidth of approx 100Mbps. Ethernet 100BaseT is one of the most popular Star topology networks.

**Disadvantages of star topology**

- **A Central point of failure:** If the central hub or switch goes down, then all the connected nodes will not be able to communicate with each other.
- **Cable:** Sometimes cable routing becomes difficult when a significant amount of routing is required.

#### 4.1.2.3 Ring / Circular Topology

- A ring topology is a network configuration in which device connections create a circular data path.
- Ring topology is like a bus topology, but with connected ends.
- The node that receives the message from the previous computer will retransmit to the next node.
- The data flows in one direction, i.e., it is unidirectional.
- The data flows in a single loop continuously known as an endless loop.
- It has no terminated ends, i.e., each node is connected to other node and having no termination point.
- The data in a ring topology flow in a clockwise direction.

![[4.4_Circular_Topology.png]]

![4.4 Circular Topology](https://github.com/anilkaraniya/college/blob/main/BCA/sem-1/notes/Computer%20Fundamentals/CF-Assets/4.4_Circular_Topology.png?raw=true)

**Advantages of ring topology**

-   **Network Management:** Faulty devices can be removed from the network without bringing the network down.
-   **Product availability:** Many hardware and software tools for network operation and monitoring are available.
-   **Cost:** Twisted pair cabling is inexpensive and easily available. Therefore, the installation cost is very low.
-   **Reliable:** It is a more reliable network because the communication system is not dependent on the single host computer.

**Disadvantages of ring topology**

-  **Difficult troubleshooting:** It requires specialized test equipment to determine the cable faults. If any fault occurs in the cable, then it would disrupt the communication for all the nodes.
-   **Failure:** The breakdown in one station leads to the failure of the overall network.
-   **Reconfiguration difficult:** Adding new devices to the network would slow down the network.
-   **Delay:** Communication delay is directly proportional to the number of nodes. Adding new devices increases the communication delay.

#### 4.1.2.4 Tree Topology

![[4.5_Tree_Topology.png]]

![4.5 Tree Topology](https://github.com/anilkaraniya/college/blob/main/BCA/sem-1/notes/Computer%20Fundamentals/CF-Assets/4.5_Tree_Topology.png?raw=true)

-   Tree topology combines the characteristics of bus topology and star topology.
-   A tree topology is a type of structure in which all the computers are connected with each other in hierarchical fashion.
-   The top-most node in tree topology is known as a root node, and all other nodes are the descendants of the root node.
-   There is only one path exists between two nodes for the data transmission. Thus, it forms a parent-child hierarchy.

 **Advantages of Tree topology**

-   **Support for broadband transmission:** Tree topology is mainly used to provide broadband transmission, i.e., signals are sent over long distances without being attenuated.
-   **Easily expandable:** We can add the new device to the existing network. Therefore, we can say that tree topology is easily expandable.
-   **Easily manageable:** In tree topology, the whole network is divided into segments known as star networks which can be easily managed and maintained.
-   **Error detection:** Error detection and error correction are very easy in a tree topology.
-   **Limited failure:** The breakdown in one station does not affect the entire network.
-   **Point-to-point wiring:** It has point-to-point wiring for individual segments.

**Disadvantages of Tree topology**

-   **Difficult troubleshooting:** If any fault occurs in the node, then it becomes difficult to troubleshoot the problem.
-   **High cost:** Devices required for broadband transmission are very costly.
-   **Failure:** A tree topology mainly relies on main bus cable and failure in main bus cable will damage the overall network.
-   **Reconfiguration difficult:** If new devices are added, then it becomes difficult to reconfigure.

#### 4.1.2.5 Mesh Topology

- A mesh topology is the one where every node is connected to every other node in the
network

![[4.6_Mesh_Topology.png]]

![4.6 Mesh Topology](https://github.com/anilkaraniya/college/blob/main/BCA/sem-1/notes/Computer%20Fundamentals/CF-Assets/4.6_Mesh_Topology.png?raw=true)

-   There are multiple paths from one computer to another computer.
-   It does not contain the switch, hub or any central computer which acts as a central point of communication.
-   The Internet is an example of the mesh topology.

**Advantages of a mesh topology**

**Reliable:** The mesh topology networks are very reliable as if any link breakdown will not affect the communication between connected computers.
**Fast Communication:** Communication is very fast between the nodes.
**Easier Reconfiguration:** Adding new devices would not disrupt the communication between other devices.

**Disadvantages of a mesh topology**

-   **Cost:** A mesh topology contains a large number of connected devices such as a router and more transmission media than other topologies.
-   **Management:** Mesh topology networks are very large and very difficult to maintain and manage. If the network is not monitored carefully, then the communication link failure goes undetected.
-   **Efficiency:** In this topology, redundant connections are high that reduces the efficiency of the network.

## 4.2 TYPES OF NETWORK

### 4.2.1 LAN(LAN)

- A LAN is generally confined to a specific location, such as floor, building or some other small area.
- The technology is less expensive to implement than WAN because you are keeping all of your expenses to a small area, and generally you can obtain higher speed.

![[4.7_LAN.png]]

![4.7 LAN](https://github.com/anilkaraniya/college/blob/main/BCA/sem-1/notes/Computer%20Fundamentals/CF-Assets/4.7_LAN.png?raw=true)

- LANs often use a transmission all the machines are attached with each other.
- Traditional LANs runs at speed of 10 to 100 mbps have low delay and make very few errors. 
- Never LANs may operate at higher speed up to 100 megabytes/sec.

**Advantages**

- Transmission of data and services is relatively higher than other network connections.
- The Network Server acts as a central unit for the whole network.

**Disadvantages**

- Need constant administration of experienced engineers for functioning.
- Probability of leak of sensitive data by LAN administration

### 4.2.2 WAN(WAN)

- A wide area network spans a large geographical area, often a country or continent.
- It multiplies multiple connected LANs; that can be separated by any geographical distance.
- In most WANs the network contains numerous cables or telephone lines, each one connection a pair of routers. 
- If two routers that do not share a cable nevertheless and wish to communicate, they must do it indirectly.
- On personal computers we are using modem to communicate indirectly with other computer.

![[4.8_WAN.png]]

![4.8 WAN](https://github.com/anilkaraniya/college/blob/main/BCA/sem-1/notes/Computer%20Fundamentals/CF-Assets/4.8_WAN.png?raw=true)

**Advantages**

- This network covers a high geographical area and is used for large- distance connections.
- They also use radio towers and connect channels for users.

**Disadvantages**

- High cost to set up the network and the Support of experienced technicians is needed to maintain the network.
- It is difficult to prevent hacking and debug a large network.

### 4.2.3 MAN(MAN)

- Metropolitan Area Network is basically a bigger version of LAN and normally uses same technology.
- MAN is network running through out a metropolitan are such as a backbone for a phone service carrier. 
- A MAN just has one or two cables and does not contain switching elements.

**Advantages**

- Provides Full-Duplex data transmission in the network channel for devices.
- The network connection area covers an entire city or some parts using the optic cables.

**Disadvantages**

- High probability of attack from hackers and cybercriminals due to large networks.
- The need for good quality hardware and the installation cost is very high

## 4.3 REPEATERS, BRIDGES, ROUTERS, BROUTERS, GATEWAY

### 4.3.1 REPEATERS

- When an electrical signal is sent across a medium, It fades along the distance (known as attenuation) as a result of resistance from the medium itself. At some point the signal is so fade the receiving station cannot recognise the original message
- In short each transmission medium can be used for a certain distance.
- However you can exceed the physical medium's maximum effective distance by using an amplification, device called as Repeater.
- A repeater operates at the physical layer of the OSI model and takes a signal from one LAN and sends it to another LAN- reconditioning and retiming it in the process.
- The reconditioning usually amplifies and boosts the signal's power.
- The repeaters job is simple: it detects the signal, amplifies and retimes it, and sends it through all the ports except the one on which the signal was seen.
- since the repeater has no real knowledge of the data it is carrying, no error checking is performed.

**Pros**

- Allow you to extend the network over large distances.
- Do not affect the speed of network

**Cons**

- Have no knowledge of addressing or data types.
- Can't ease network congestion problems

### 4.3.2 BRIDGES

- Bridges connects two separate networks to form a logical one by operating at the data link layer of the OSI model.
- Bridges rely on MAC addresses for their operation.
- bridges examine the packet's destination address before forwarding it to other segments.
- A bridge extends the maximum distance of your network by connecting separate network segments, and selectively pass signals from one medium segment to another.
- If a packet has a destination address on the same network segment as the source of the signal, the bridge ignore the signal.
- Since bridges are selective about which data packets can be transferred, they are useful in solving traffic bottlenecks
- however that bridges do not reduce traffic caused by broadcast packets or broadcast storms.

**Bridges offer following advantages over hubs :**

- Divide a large network segment into smaller segments and hence reduce data traffic and improves network performance.
- Filter local data traffic by not allowing them to cross other network segments hence reducing overall network traffic.
- Provide exclusive bandwidth (10 Mbps) to each node connected to a port on a bridge as opposed to shared bandwidth provided by hubs.
- Can be used to connect network segments of dissimilar media.

**Pro**

- Can act as a repeater and extend distance
- Easy to install, load, and configure
- Can restrict flow and ease congestion
- Useful for protocols that can't be routed
- Have good cost – to – performance ration

**Cons**

- Slower than repeaters due to the need to examine addresses.
- Can't perform effective balancing on larger networks
- More expensive than repeaters
- Can’t prevent broadcast storms
- Certain application might not run on bridge networks.

### 4.3.3 ROUTERS

- While bridges are limited to examine data packets MAC addresses, routers go beyond this and-can examine the network address-which has routing information encoded in it.
- Routers can use this information to make intelligent decisions about routes and paths.
- In the simplest form routers like bridges-can be used to connect network segments.
- Unlike Bridge who knows only one path, routers are aware of multiple paths that lead to a destination address and know which path is best.
- Each node on the network is then assigned an address.
- Every data packet sent contains the destination network address and node address.
- The optimum path can then be determined by looking at infernal routing table.
- The router must initialize and maintain the routing table and determine the next stop in the packet’s journey, a router is expected to be able to identify the address and only send packets for which it has a network address.
- If a machine address isn't found in the routing table, the packet is discarded.

Routers are normally responsible for performing the following functions :

**Route selection -**
A router is maintaining the information in its routing table about how to reach remote
networks. It will then make routing decisions based on that information

**Logical addressing-**
A device that operates at layer 3 requires some form of logical addressing. These addresses
will be used to determine route selection.

**Segmentation-**
Routers can be provide by a powerful method of segmenting your networks to allow
optimum utilization of available bandwidth.

**Advantages of using Routers**

- **No broadcasts –** Because router operates at Layer 3 of the OSI mode), no Layer 2 broadcasts wiII be forwarded through a router.

- **Manageability –** Routers have a better knowledge of the network topology than bridges and switches do and have the ability to support more protocols than bridges and switches

- **Increased bandwidth –** By segmenting your networks with routers, your nodes/ hosts will have more access bandwidth

- **Packet fragmentation and reassembling -** Routers provide, packet fragmentation / reassembly functions, as well as better Security.

Pros
- Can perform more functions thanbridges
- Can interconnect network segments of differing architectures.
- Can manage load balancing andsharing
- Can be used to control broadcast storms
- Can choose the best path and make dynamic changes

**Cons**

- Considerably more difficult to install than Bridge
- More expensive than repeaters or bridges
- Work only with routable protocols
- Static routing can cause problems
- Much slower than bridges or repeaters due to additional functions.

### 4.3.4 BROUTERS

- If a routable packet is received, the brouter routes the data to the appropriate destination.
- If a no routable protocol sends data, however the brouter bridges the data based on the hardware address.
- In order to perform both functions, the brouter must contain both a routing table and a bridging table.
- As a result it operates at both the Network arid Data Link Layer.
- Brouters are more expensive and complex than bridges and routers.

### 4.3.5 GATEWAY

- With a gateway, data is translated between two different data formats or network architectures.
- Gateways perform much higher-level translations than any other component and thus work at the Application layer of the OSI module.
- When packets arrive at a gateway, all the information is stripped off the data until it reaches the layer where it can translate the information-using the format needed for the destination

**Pros**

- Can connect completely different systems.
- Specialize in one task only

**Cons**

- Very expensive than other devices.
- Difficult to install and configure. Depending oh the level of translation, can be very slow

## 4.4 MODEM, Wi-Fi NETWORK, BLUETOOTH AND INFRA- RED DEVICES

### 4.4.1 MODEM FOR COMMUNICATION BETWEEN PCs

- Modem converts your computer digital signal to an analog transmission signal to use with telephone lines or microwave transceivers.
- Modem is necessary because telephone lines and microwave media uses electromagnetic waves, but your computer uses electric pulses.
- modems can be used to amplify signals.

### 4.4.2 Wi-Fi NETWORK

- Wi-Fi stands for Wireless Fidelity.
- Wi-Fi is a brand originally licensed by the Wi-Fi alliance to describe the underlying technology of wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) based on IEEE 802.11 specifications.
- The region covered by one or several access points is called a hot spot.
- Hot spots can be range from a single room to many square miles of overlapping hot spots.
- Wireless Networks uses radio waves as its carrier.
- The typical Wi-Fi setup contains one or more Access points (APs) and one or more clients. 
- A AP broadcasts its SSID (Service Set Identifier, Network Name) via packets that called beacons, which are broadcasted every 100 ms.
- The beacons are transmitted at 1 Mb/s and are relatively short and therefore are not of influence on performance.
- Wi-Fi uses spectrum near 2.4 GHz, which is a standardized and unlicensed by international agreement.

### 4.4.3 INTRODUCTION OF BLUETOOTH

- Bluetooth technology is based on Ad-hoc technology also known as Ad-hoc Pico nets, which is a local area network with a very limited coverage.
- WLAN technology enables device connectivity to infrastructure based services through a wireless carrier provider.
- Bluetooth employs Radio Frequency (RF) for communication. 
- It makes use of frequency modulation to generate radio waves in the ISM band.

The usage of Bluetooth has widely increased for its special features.

- Bluetooth offers a uniform structure for a wide range of devices to connect and communicate with each other.
- Bluetooth technology has achieved global acceptance such that any Bluetooth enabled device, almost everywhere in the world, can be connected with Bluetooth enabled devices.
- Low power consumption of Bluetooth technology and an offered range of up to ten meters has paved the way for several usage models.
- Bluetooth offers interactive conference by establishing an adhoc network of laptops.

![[4.10_Piconets_and_scatternets.png]]

![4.10 Piconets and scatternets](https://github.com/anilkaraniya/college/blob/main/BCA/sem-1/notes/Computer%20Fundamentals/CF-Assets/4.10_Piconets_and_scatternets.png?raw=true)

**Spectrum**
- Bluetooth technology operates in the unlicensed industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) band at 2.4 to 2.485 GHZ, using a spread spectrum hopping, full-duplex signal at a nominal rate of 1600 hops/sec. the 2.4 GHZ ISM band is available and unlicensed in most countries. 

**Range**
- Bluetooth operating range depends on the device Class 3 radios have a range of up to 1 meter or 3 feet Class 2 radios are most commonly found in mobile devices have a range of 10 meters or 30 feet Class 1 radios are used primarily in industrial use cases have a range of 100 meters or 300 feet.

**Data rate**
- Bluetooth supports 1Mbps data rate for version 1.2 and 3Mbps data rate for Version 2.0 combined with Error Data Rate.

### 4.4.4 INTRODUCTION OF INFRARED DEVICES

- It is the use of infrared transmission technology in devices and equipment for sending data to other devices and/or controlling them wirelessly by human operators.
- Infrared wireless is primarily implemented in short range areas and facilities, more specifically where there is the least amount of obstruction such as wooden or concrete  walls.
- Infrared wireless is implemented through two different modes.
- The first mode is called line of sight infrared wireless.
- The receiving device must be directly in line of sight of the infrared broadcasting device.
- The distance between both devices usually must not be greater than ten meters.
- televisions, air-conditioners, etc
- The second mode is called scatter mode infrared wireless.
- The infrared signals/rays are broadcasted within a specific room or vicinity.
- Any receiving device either in sight or out of sight can receive infrared signals directly or through reflection.

![[4.11_Infrared_devices.png]]

![4.11 Infrared devices](https://github.com/anilkaraniya/college/blob/main/BCA/sem-1/notes/Computer%20Fundamentals/CF-Assets/4.11_Infrared_devices.png?raw=true)

Some key infrared points are as follows:

- It provides adequate speeds—up to 16Mbps.
- Infrared devices use less power and therefore don’t drain batteries as much.
- Infrared is a secure medium. Infrared signals typically are a direct-line implementation in a short range and therefore do not travel far outside the immediate connection. This eliminates the problem of eavesdropping or signal tampering.
- Infrared is a proven technology. Infrared devices have been available for some time and as such are a proven, nonproprietary technology with an established user and support base.
- It has no radio frequency interference issues or signal conflicts.
- It replaces cables for many devices, such as keyboards, mice, and other peripherals.
- It uses a dispersed mode or a direct line-of-sight transmission.
- Transmissions travel over short distances.

## 4.5 NETWORK PROTOCOLS

- This transmission media connects the systems, and a set of rules determines how they communicate.
- These rules are known as protocol.
- A network protocol is software installed on machine that determines the agreed-upon set of rules for two or more machines to communicate with each other.

Common protocols in the Microsoft family include the following.

• NetBEUI
• NWLink
• DLC (Data Link Control)
• TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol)

## 4.6 ARCHITECTURE

### 4.6.1 PEER-TO-PEER ARCHITECTURE

- In a Peer-to-Peer network you take the machine currently in existence, install networking cards in them, and connect them through some type of cabling.
- Each machine is known as Peer and can participate in the sharing of files or resources.
- there is also no real security.
- Access permission can be Read-Only, Full or depend on password this is known as share level security.
- Access is gained when a user supplies the correct password to access the share.

**Advantages of peer-to-peer network**

•Server is not required
•No additional cost for dedicated-machine

**Disadvantages of peer-to peer network**

•Provides share level security
•Can work in small environments only.

### 4.6.2 CLIENT/ SERVER

- With the user level security, permissions are based on how the user logged on and was authenticated by the server.
- In this environment, you can assign permissions to shared based on user permissions or group permissions.
- This scenario also known as client/server networks
- server- based networking's down side is that it requires a dedicated machine (the server); the upside is that you gain centralize administration, you can add ail users at one location, control logon scripts and backups; and so on.

**Advantages of Server based network**

- Provides user level security
- You always gain centralize administration
- Can work in big environments also

**Disadvantages of server based network**

- Dedicated machine is required
- Cost of the system is more compared to peer-to peer networks.
