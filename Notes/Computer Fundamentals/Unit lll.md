### 3.1.4 TOUCH SCREEN

- A touch screen is an input/output touch-sensitive display.
- Touchscreens work using electricity. 
- The screen is made of glass, an insulating material – it cannot carry an electric current.
- The surface of the screen is therefore coated with a thin layer of an electrically conducting material such as indium tin oxide. 
- This is chosen because it is transparent.
- The conducting layer is connected to a low voltage so that for a short time, there is a tiny electric current on the screen. 
- This leaves it with a small electric charge.
- When your finger touches the screen, some of the small electrical charge flows on to it.
- Sensitive detectors round the edge of the screen can detect which point on the screen has lost charge so that it knows which point has been touched.

![[3.4_Working_of_Touch_Screen.png]]

![3.4 Working of Touch Screen](https://github.com/anilkaraniya/college/blob/main/BCA/sem-1/notes/Computer%20Fundamentals/CF-Assets/3.4_Working_of_Touch_Screen.png?raw=true)

### 3.1.7 OCR

- Optical Character Recognition (OCR) software’s are intelligent programs which can convert a scanned page of text into editable text either into a plain text file, a Word document or even an Excel spreadsheet which can be easily edited.
- OCR can also be used to scan and recognize printed, typewritten or even handwritten text.
- The OCR software requires a raster image as an input, which may be an existing image file or an image transferred from a scanner.
- OCR analyzes the image to find blocks of image information that resemble possible text fields and creates an index of such areas.

**Advantages of OCR readers include**
- Written data and printed data can be read at the same time.
- Hard copies of documents can be read directly into a computer without retyping.
- The characters converted can later be edited by word processing software.
- It is quicker to extract text from a document and to use it via word processor.
- It is useful for people with visual impairments because after extracting text from document, a text-to-speech software can be used to read it aloud.

**Disadvantages of OCR readers include**

- OCR readers often do not work well with handwritten characters or those in unusual fonts.
- The text recognized by OCR software is not always accurate.


### 3.1.8 OMR

**Disadvantages:**
- Paper forms can be read accurately only if they are lined up properly.
- The dirty marks on the paper can be read by OMR as well which leads to wrong results.

### 3.1.9 BARCODE READER

- A barcode reader is an electronic device which is used to read printed barcodes.
- Barcodes represent alphanumeric data which is a combination of vertical lines (bars) that vary in width and length.
- A Barcode reader uses a laser beam to read the series of thick and thin lines which represent the bar code number.
- The bar code is 13 digits long and it has four main divisions.
- The First two digits of a bar code represent the country, the second part represents the manufacturer’s code (five digits).
- A barcode reader is a combination of scanner hardware and software. 
- The scanner captures the image of barcode while software decodes the barcode in captured image.

### 3.1.10 FLATBED SCANNER

**Loading a Document**

- A scanner needs a source document from which to begin – anything from a photograph to a letter.
- In the case of a flatbed scanner, this document is placed against the top glass surface of the scanner and the lid is closed over the document to prevent light from entering the  device.
- The transparent glass keeps the document in place while allowing the sensors to detect document details.

**Mechanics**

- Once the document is in place and the lid is closed, a moving belt slides a light source across the entire surface of the document.
- The motor in a scanner is finely tuned to make sure this light source travels at the same speed and creates the same amount of light across the whole document, ensuring a uniform exposure.
- The light shined on the document then reflects back into the machine and is reflected onto the lens by a series of mirrors.

![[3.7_Working_of_a_Flatbed_Scanner.png]]

![3.7 Working of a Flatbed Scanner](https://github.com/anilkaraniya/college/blob/main/BCA/sem-1/notes/Computer%20Fundamentals/CF-Assets/3.7_Working_of_a_Flatbed_Scanner.png?raw=true)

**Optics**

- Much like a digital camera lens, a scanner lens includes a photosensitive element that detects differences in reflected light as different shades of color.
- These devices turn shades of light reflected off the document into digital information on shades of color to be located at different parts of the final document.

**Sending a Document**

- The optic information from a scanner sensor is turned into digital pixel information in order to be saved as a digital file, such as a JPG, PNG or TIFF.
- A scanner relays this information to a computer through a wireless or connecting cable connection to save the digital file. 
- After the transfer, the image file of the document is accessible on the computer and can be opened, saved, edited or deleted just like any other digital picture file.


## 3.2 OUTPUT DEVICES

- Output device receives information from the CPU and presents it to the user in the desired from.
