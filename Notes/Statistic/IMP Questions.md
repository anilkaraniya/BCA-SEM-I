**Q1] What is statistics? Explain its application?**

- Statistics is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data.
- In other words, it is a mathematical discipline to collect, summarize data.
- Also, we can say that statistics is a branch of applied mathematics.
- However, there are two important and basic ideas involved in statistics; they are uncertainty and variation.
- The uncertainty and variation in different fields can be determined only through statistical analysis
- These uncertainties are basically determined by the probability  that plays an important role in statistics.
- According to statistician **Sir Arthur Lyon Bowley,** statistics is defined as “Numerical statements of facts in any department of inquiry placed in relation to each other”.
- **Applications of Statistics** are :- 

1.  Application of Statistics in Statistical Modeling
	- Statistical modelling involves developing predictive models based on design, pattern perception and data development.
	- Modelling is widely used in prediction of election results, survival analysis of populations and scientific surveys.
	- These tools are used by Meteorologists to  predict the weather

2. Application of Statistics in Government Sectors
	- As a regulatory body government decisions are mostly outcomes of well-researched statistics and figures on which decisions are made related to health, populations, education, and development.

3. Application of Statistics in Clinical Trial and Design
	- The medical field also relies heavily on statistical data in order to run their operations.
	- When a new drug or treatment is discovered, it has to first be tested on a group of people to know its efficacy and safety. 
	- The process includes an analysis called trial where medications or interventions are tested to know how human bodies react to a particular treatment.

4. Application of Statistics in Psychology
	- Statistics can be used to study human behaviour and prediction of thoughts and actions that may take place in future.

5. Application of Statistics in Corporate Sectors
	- Almost every small and large business employs a dedicated statistical research division that aims to predict and analyze the companies current and predicted growth
	- Business success relies on identifying what is important and what is vague

6. Application of Statistics in Weather Forecasting
	- Weather forecasting on computers is based on a set of statistical functions. 
	- All of these statistics are used to compare the current weather to previously recorded seasons and conditions.

7. Application of Statistics in Political Campaigns
	- Statistics aids politicians, or rather, the country’s predicted future leaders, in determining how many chances they have to win an election in a specific location.

8. Application of Statistics in Financial Markets
	- Statistics are used to compute all of the stock prices. 
	- It also assists the investor in deciding whether or not to invest in a certain stock.

**Q2] Importance and scope of Statistics?**

1. **Use Descriptive Statistics to Understand the World**
	- Statistics is indispensable in planning may it be in business, economics or government level. 
	- The modern age is termed as the ‘age of planning’ and almost all organizations in the government or business or management are resorting to planning for efficient working and for formulating policy decision.
	- To achieve this end, the statistical data relating to production, consumption, birth, death, investment, income are of paramount importance. 
	- Today efficient planning is a must for almost all countries, particularly the developing economies for their economic development.

1. **Statistics in Mathematics**
	- Statistics is intimately related to and essentially dependent upon mathematics. 
	- The modern theory of Statistics has its foundations on the theory of probability which in turn is a particular branch of more advanced mathematical theory of Measures and Integration. 
	- Ever increasing role of mathematics into statistics has led to the development of a new branch of statistics called Mathematical Statistics.
	- Thus Statistics may be considered to be an important member of the mathematics family. 
	- In the words of Connor, “Statistics is a branch of applied mathematics which specializes in data”

1. **Statistics in Economics**
	- Development of modern statistical methods has led to an extensive use of statistics in Economics.
	- All the important branches of Economics—consumption, production, exchange, distribution, public finance—use statistics for the purpose of comparison, presentation, interpretation, etc. 
	- Problem of spending of income on and by different sections of the people, production of national wealth, adjustment of demand and supply, effect of economic policies on the economy etc. 
	- simply indicate the importance of statistics in the field of economics and in its different branches.
	- Statistics of Public Finance enables us to impose tax, to provide subsidy, to spend on various heads, amount of money to be borrowed or lent etc. 
	- So we cannot think of Statistics without Economics or Economics without Statistics.

1. **Statistics in Social Sciences**
	- Every social phenomenon is affected to a marked extent by a multiplicity of factors which bring out the variation in observations from time to time, place to place and object to object. 
	- Statistical tools of Regression and Correlation Analysis can be used to study and isolate the effect of each of these factors on the given observation.
	- Sampling Techniques and Estimation Theory are very powerful and indispensable tools for conducting any social survey, pertaining to any strata of society and then analyzing the results and drawing valid inferences. 
	- The most important application of statistics in sociology is in the field of Demography for studying mortality (death rates), fertility (birth rates), marriages, population growth and so on.

1. **Statistics in Trade**
	- As already mentioned, statistics is a body of methods to make wise decisions in the face of uncertainties. 
	- Business is full of uncertainties and risks. We have to forecast at every step. Speculation is just gaining or losing by way of forecasting. 
	- Can we forecast without taking into view the past? Perhaps, no. 
	- The future trend of the market can only be expected if we make use of statistics. Failure in anticipation will mean failure of business.
	- Changes in demand, supply, habits, fashion etc. can be anticipated with the help of statistics. 
	- Statistics is of utmost significance in determining prices of the various products, determining the phases of boom and depression etc. 
	- Use of statistics helps in smooth running of the business, in reducing the uncertainties and thus contributes towards the success of business.

1. **Statistics in Research Work**
	- The job of a research worker is to present the result of his research before the community. 
	- The effect of a variable on a particular problem, under differing conditions, can be known by the research worker only if he makes use of statistical methods. 
	- Statistics are everywhere basic to research activities. 
	- To keep alive his research interests and research activities, the researcher is required to lean upon his knowledge and skills in statistical methods.

**Q2.1] What are the Limitations of Statistics?**

- Statistics is a mathematical science pertaining to the collection, analysis, interpretation or explanation, and presentation of data. 
- Statisticians improve the quality of data with the design of experiments and survey sampling.
1. Statistics does not deal with isolated measurement
2. Statistics deals with only quantitative characteristics
3.  Statistics laws are true on average. Statistics are aggregates of facts. So single observation is not a statistics, it deals with groups and aggregates only.
4. Statistical methods are best applicable on quantitative data.
5. Statistical cannot be applied to heterogeneous data.
6. It sufficient care is not exercised in collecting, analyzing and interpretation the data, statistical results might be misleading.
7. Only a person who has an expert knowledge of statistics can handle statistical data efficiently.
8. Some errors are possible in statistical decisions. Particularly the inferential statistics involves certain errors. We do not know whether an error has been committed or not.

**Q3] What is data? Explain its classification?**

- Data is made up of raw numbers, typically with many variables. 
- These numbers often come from research that was conducted as part of a study or survey and are a primary source.  
- Data is often in the form of a digital data set. 
- Data is capable of being analyzed using statistical procedures. 
- Data is used to create new information or knowledge. 
- For example, census data provides data about the number of people within a particular area with variables such as gender, age, income, etc.

![Classification of data](https://github.com/anilkaraniya/college/blob/main/BCA/sem-1/notes/Statistic/stats-assets/imp_1_classification_of_data.png?raw=true)

1. Geographical Classification
	- The classification of data on the basis of geographical location or region is known as **Geographical** or **Spatial Classification**. 
	- For example, presenting the population of different states of a country is done on the basis of geographical location or region.

2. Chronological Classification
	- The classification of data with respect to different time periods is known as **Chronological** or **Temporal Classification**. 
	- For example, the number of students in a school in different years can be presented on the basis of a time period.

3. Qualitative Classification
	- The classification of data on the basis of descriptive or qualitative characteristics like region, caste, sex, gender, education, etc., is known as **Qualitative Classification.** 
	- A qualitative classification can not be quantified and can be of two types; viz., **Simple Classification** and **Manifold Classification.** 
	 **Simple Classification**
		- When based on only one attribute, the given data is classified into two classes, which is known as **Simple Classification**.
		- For example, when the population is divided into literate and illiterate, it is a simple classification.
		- ![[imp_2_simple_classification.png]]
		![simple classification](https://github.com/anilkaraniya/college/blob/main/BCA/Statistic/stats-assets/imp_2_simple_classification.png?raw=true)
	**Manifold Classification**
		- When based on more than one attribute, the given data is classified into different classes, and then sub-divided into more sub-classes, which is known as **Manifold Classification.** 
		- For example, when the population is divided into literate and illiterate, then sub-divided into male and female, and further sub-divided into married and unmarried, it is a manifold classification.
		- ![[imp_3_Manifold_Classification.png]]
		![Manifold Classification](https://github.com/anilkaraniya/college/blob/main/BCA/Statistic/stats-assets/imp_3_Manifold_Classification.png?raw=true)

1. Quantitative Classification
	- The classification of data on the basis of the characteristics, such as age, height, weight, income, etc., that can be measured in quantity is known as **Quantitative Classification**. 
	- For example, the weight of students in a class can be classified as quantitative classification.

**Q4] What is tabulation?**

- Tabulation is a systematic and logical representation of numeric data in rows and columns to facilitate comparison and statistical analysis. 
- It facilitates comparison by bringing related information close to each other and helps in statistical analysis and interpretation.
- In other words, the method of placing organised data into a tabular form is known as tabulation. 
- It may be complex, double, or simple, depending upon the nature of categorisation.
- **Objectives Of Tabulation**:

**(1) To simplify complex data**
-   It reduces the bulk of information, i.e., it reduces raw data in a simplified and meaningful form so that it can be easily interpreted by a common man in less time.

**(2) To bring out essential features of data**
-   It brings out the chief/main characteristics of data.
-   It presents facts clearly and precisely without textual explanation.

**(3) To facilitate comparison**
-   The representation of data in rows and columns is helpful in simultaneous detailed comparison on the basis of several parameters.

**(4) To facilitate statistical analysis**
-   Tables serve as the best source of organised data for statistical analysis.
-   The task of computing average, dispersion, correlation, etc., becomes easier if data is presented in the form of a table.

**(5) To save space**
-   A table presents facts in a better way than the textual form.
-   It saves space without sacrificing the quality and quantity of data.

**Q5] Different types of diagram in statistics?**

- Statistics involves the collection of data from multiple quantities for the purpose of analysis and finding information. 
- The data that is being collected can be represented with charts and diagrams.
- From the charts and diagrams, you will be able to make an analysis and possibly predict future outcomes.
- Following are some of the graphs:- 

**1. Bar chart**
- Bar charts are used to compare data. 
- The data is organized in categories in form of rectangular bars on a graph and from there you can compare different categories of data.
- The rectangular bars are usually of different heights and they can be represented horizontally or vertically.
 - Uses of bar charts
	1.  A bar chart is used to visually display and analyze data.
	2.  It is used to compare data in categories.
	3.  It is used for illustration purposes.

**2. Pie chart**
- This chart is called a pie chart because it is circular and it is sectioned in a way that it looks like slices of a pie. 
- The pie chart represents data that is split into different categories. The categories are the slices of the pie.
- Uses of Pie chart
	1.  A pie chart is used to split complex data into smaller and simpler categories.
	2.  It is used to show the proportion of categories of data.

**3. Histogram**
- Just like the bar chart, the data in a histogram chart is represented with bars but a histogram organizes data in ranges. 
- It shows the frequency at which different ranges of data occur.
- Uses of a histogram
	1.  Display data in categories and ranges.
	2.  Find the frequency of an event.
	3.  Organize and summarize a large set of data.

**4. Line chart**
- A line chart is also called, a line plot or line graph. 
- It is used to show how variables and information change over time. 
- The information on a line chart is represented with points and the points are connected with a continuous line.
- Uses of a Line chart
	1.  See how data changes over time.
	2.  Track the trend of an occurrence.
	3.  Show and compare change over time.

**5. Flow chart**
- A flow chart is a process diagram. 
- It shows the steps to follow for a particular process and also makes the steps easier to follow. If the procedure is a complex one, it can be made simpler with a flowchart.
- Uses of a flow chart
	1.  Show the process of a system.
	2.  Study the process of a system.
	3.  Document the process of a system.
	4.  Communicate clearly how a system works.

**Q6] mean, median, mode characteristics and importance?**

**Mean:** 
- Mean is the most commonly used measure of central tendency. 
- It actually represents the average of the given collection of data. It is applicable for both continuous and discrete data.
- It is equal to the sum of all the values in the collection of data divided by the total number of values.
- The mean is used when both of the following conditions are met:
1. Data is scaled
	a) Data with equal intervals like speed, weight, height, temperature, etc.
2. Distribution is normal
	b) The mean is sensitive to outliers that are found in skewed distributions, you should only use the mean when the distribution is more or less normal.

> **∑(fi.xi)/∑fi**

**characteristics**:- 
**1.** It can only be used with quantitative data.
**2.** The mean will always exist, but it might not be an actual data value.
**3.** Every data value has an affect on the mean, unlike the median and the mode.
**4.** It is the center of the data set in that it is the balance point of the data values.
**5.** It can be more sensitive to extreme data values than the median.
**6.** When used as the center value, it minimizes the sum of the squared deviations.

**Median:** 
- Generally median represents the mid-value of the given set of data when arranged in a particular order.
- The median is used when either one of two conditions are met. If the,
1. Data is ordinal
2. Distribution is skewed or non-normal.

>**x=1/2(lower limit + upper limit)**

**characteristics**:- 
**1.** It can only be used with quantitative data.
**2.** The median will always exist, but it might not be an actual data value.
**3.** It is the center of the data set in that: At least half of the data values are greater than or equal to it, and at least half of the data values are less than or equal to it.
**4.** It can be less sensitive to extreme data values than the mean.
**5.** When used as the center value, it minimizes the sum of the absolute deviations.

**Mode:**
- The most frequent number occurring in the data set is known as the mode
- The Mode is used when you want to know the most frequent response, number or observation in a distribution.

> **Median, Me = l + {h x (N/2 – cf )/f}**     
> 
> Where, 
> 
> -   l = lower limit of median class.
> -   h = width of median class.
> -   f = frequency of median class, 
> -   cf = cumulative frequency of the class preceding the median class.
> -   N = ∑fi

**characteristics**:- 
**1.** It can be used with quantitative and qualitative data.
**2.** The mode won’t always exist, but if it does, it must be an actual value of the data set.
**3.** It might not be located near the center of the data values.
**4.** It can be less sensitive to extreme data values than both the median and the mean.

**Q8] What are absolute measures of dispersion and relative measures of dispersion?**

- Measures of dispersion measure the scatter of the data, that is how far the values in the distribution are. 
- These measures capture the variation between different values of the data. 
- Intuitively, dispersion is the measure of the extent to which the points of the distribution differ from the average of the distribution. 
- Measures of dispersion can be classified into two categories shown below:  

1.  Absolute Measures of Dispersion
2.  Relative Measures of Dispersion

**1.  Absolute Measures of Dispersion**
- An absolute measure of dispersion contains the same unit as the original data set. 
- The absolute dispersion method expresses the variations in terms of the average of deviations of observations like standard or means deviations. 
- It includes range, standard deviation, quartile deviation, etc.

The types of absolute measures of dispersion are:

1.  **Range:** It is simply the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value given in a data set. Example: 1, 3,5, 6, 7 => Range = 7 -1= 6
2.  **Variance:** Deduct the mean from each data in the set, square each of them and add each square and finally divide them by the total no of values in the data set to get the variance. Variance (σ2) = ∑(X−μ)2/N
3.  **Standard Deviation:** The square root of the variance is known as the standard deviation i.e. S.D. = √σ.
4.  **Quartiles and Quartile Deviation:** The quartiles are values that divide a list of numbers into quarters. The quartile deviation is half of the distance between the third and the first quartile.
5.  **Mean and Mean Deviation:** The average of numbers is known as the mean and the arithmetic mean of the absolute deviations of the observations from a measure of central tendency is known as the mean deviation (also called mean absolute deviation).

**Q9] What are relative measures of dispersion?**

The relative measures of **dispersion** are employed for comparing the distribution of two data sets or more. They are used to compare the different unit sets. These include: 

1.  Co-efficient of range
2.  Co-efficient of variation
3.  Co-efficient of standard deviation
4.  Co-efficient of quartile deviation
5.  Co-efficient of mean deviation 

| C.D. in terms of          | Coefficient of dispersion            |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Range                     | C.D. = (Xmax – Xmin) ⁄ (Xmax + Xmin) |
| Quartile Deviation        | C.D. = (Q3 – Q1) ⁄ (Q3 + Q1)         |
| Standard Deviation (S.D.) | C.D. = S.D. ⁄ Mean                   |
| Mean Deviation            | C.D. = Mean deviation/Average                                     |

We calculate the dispersion coefficient when two series varying widely in their averages are to be compared. It is also used to compare two series having varied measurement units. The coefficient of **dispersion** is denoted as C.D. 

The commonly used coefficients of dispersion have been listed below: 
-   Co-efficient of **dispersion** in terms of range : 
C.D. = (Xmax – Xmin) ⁄ (Xmax + Xmin)

-   Co-efficient of **dispersion** in terms of Quartile deviation: 
C.D. = (Q3 – Q1) ⁄ (Q3 + Q1)

-   Co-efficient of dispersion in terms of Standard deviation: 
C.D. = S.D. ⁄ Mean

-   Co-efficient of **dispersion** in terms of Mean deviation: 
C.D. = Mean deviation/Average

**Formulas of Measures of Dispersion**

Some useful formulas of measures of **dispersion** are: 
-   **Arithmetic means formula**: Arithmetic mean is calculated by adding all the numbers in the data set and dividing the result by the total number of values. For example: The arithmetic mean of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 is (1 +2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) / 7 = 28/7 = 4

>The formula represents it
 >A=1ni=1nai
>Where, A = Arithmetic Mean
>n = number of values
>**ai**= data set values

-   **Standard deviation formula**: The formula for standard deviation helps find dispersed data set values. It can be described as the deviation from the average value. A lower standard deviation suggests that the values are close to their average, and similarly, a higher standard deviation suggests that the values are far from their average. 

Standard deviation can further be categorized into two types: 
-   **Population Standard Deviation**

> =xi-**μ2N**
   > Where σ denotes population standard deviation

-   **Sample Standard Deviation**

>=i=**1Nxi- x2N-1**
> Where s denotes sample standard deviation.

-   **Quartile formula**: The role of the quartile is to divide the observations into four parts. The middle term present between the median and the first term is the lower quartile (Q1). Likewise, the value of the middle term lying between the median and the last term is called the upper quartile (Q3). The second quartile, the median, is denoted by Q2.

When the observations in the set are arranged in ascending order:

>The 25th percentile is given by: Q1 = [(n + 1)/4]th term
>The 50th percentile or the median is given as Q2 = [(n + 1)/2]th term 
>The 75th percentile is given by: Q3 = [3(n + 1)/4]th term

-   **Variance formula**: The variance formula is used to ascertain how far the numbers spread out. It tells how greatly the individual numbers in a given set vary. If there is a huge variation in the set of variables, then the variance number is significant, and if there is less variation, the variance number is small. The variance values come out to be zero if all the values in a set are identical. 

Variance is of two types – variance of population and variance of the sample. 

>The variance formula for grouped data (population) is: **σ****2 **= ∑ f (m − x̅****)****2** **/ n**
>The variance formula for grouped data (sample) is: **s****2** **= ∑ f (m − x̅****)****2****/ n-1
>Here f denotes the class frequency, and m denotes the midpoint of the class.

-   **Interquartile range formula**: The interquartile range formula measures the variability in a set when divided into different quartiles. The values dividing the set are the first quartile, second quartile, and third quartile. The middle term present between the median and the first term is the lower quartile (Q1). Likewise, the value of the middle term lying between the median and the last term is called the upper quartile (Q3). The second quartile, the median, is denoted by Q2

>The formula for interquartile range is IQR =Q3−Q1
>QR denotes the interquartile range, Q3 denotes the third quartile, and Q1 denotes the first quartile.

**Q10] What are measures of corelation? Explain its types?**

- Correlation is a statistical calculation that indicates that two variables are parallelly related (which means that the variables change together at a constant rate). 
- It is a simple and popularly used tool for defining relationships without delivering a statement concerning the cause and effect.
- In simple words, correlation is a statistical calculation that estimates the point at which the two variables shift in relation to each other.
- Types of corelation
	1.  Positive and negative correlation
		- If one set of information increases when the other increases, that is a positive correlation. If you plot your data on a graph, a positive correlation would typically show a line extending from the lower-left corner of your chart toward the top right.
		- If one set of information decreases when the other increases, it is a negative correlation. Negative correlations usually look somewhat like a line extending from the chart's top left to the bottom right. Negative correlations work the same way as positive ones, but their correlation coefficients are less than zero. A perfect negative correlation would have a correlation coefficient of -1.

	2.  Linear and non-linear correlation
		- Linear correlation is defined when the ratio of proportion of two given variables are same/constant. Example- every time when the income increases by 20% there is a rise in expenditure of 5%.  
		- Non-linear correlation is defined as when the ratio of variations between two given variables changes. Example- with the 20% increase in the income the expenditure sometimes increase by 5% sometimes by 10% or by 15%. Hence, it is non-linear correlation.

	1.  Simple, multiple, and partial correlation
		- **Simple, Partial and Multiple Correlation:** Whether the correlation is simple, partial or multiple depends on the **number of variables studied**. 
		- The correlation is said to be simple when **only two variables** are studied. The correlation is either multiple or partial when three or more variables are studied. The correlation is said to be Multiple when **three variables are studied simultaneously**. Such as, if we want to study the relationship between the yield of wheat per acre and the amount of fertilizers and rainfall used, then it is a problem of multiple correlations.
		- Whereas, in the case of a partial correlation we study more than two variables, **but consider only two among them that would be influencing each** other such that the effect of the other influencing variable is kept constant. Such as, in the above example, if we study the relationship between the yield and fertilizers used during the periods when certain average temperature existed, then it is a problem of partial correlation.

**Q11] What are different types of means?**

- The arithmetic mean is the most commonly used mean. It’s often simply called the mean or the average. But there are some other types of means you can calculate depending on your research purposes:
- **Mean = Sum of Given Data / Total Number of Data**

1. **Weighted mean:** 
	- some values contribute more to the mean than others.
	- When the values are not of equal importance, we assign them certain numerical values to express their relative importance. 
	- These numerical values are called weights.
	- ![Weighted mean](https://econtutorials.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/clip_image036.png)

2. **Geometric mean:** 
	- values are multiplied rather than summed up.
	- The geometric mean, G, of a set of _n_ positive values X1, X2, ……, Xn is the nth root of the product of the values. 
	- Mathematically the formula for geometric mean will be as follows;

3. **Harmonic mean:** 
	- reciprocals of values are used instead of the values themselves.
	- The harmonic mean, **H, of a set of n values X1, X2, ……, Xn** is the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the values. 
	- Mathematically, the formula for harmonic mean will be as follows;
