## 1.1 Introduction & Definition of Statistics

### 1.1.1 Introduction

- Statistics is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data.
- In other words, it is a mathematical discipline to collect, summarize data.
- Also, we can say that statistics is a branch of applied mathematics.
- However, there are two important and basic ideas involved in statistics; they are uncertainty and variation.
- The uncertainty and variation in different fields can be determined only through statistical analysis
- These uncertainties are basically determined by the probability  that plays an important role in statistics.
- According to statistician **Sir Arthur Lyon Bowley,** statistics is defined as “Numerical statements of facts in any department of inquiry placed in relation to each other”.

### 1.1.2 Applications of Statistics 

1.  Application of Statistics in **Statistical Modeling**
	- Statistical modelling involves developing predictive models based on design, pattern perception and data development.
	- Modelling is widely used in prediction of election results, survival analysis of populations and scientific surveys.
	- These tools are used by Meteorologists to predict the weather

2. Application of Statistics in **Government Sectors**
	- As a regulatory body government decisions are mostly outcomes of well-researched statistics and figures on which decisions are made related to health, populations, education, and development.

3. Application of Statistics in **Clinical Trial and Design**
	- The medical field also relies heavily on statistical data in order to run their operations.
	- When a new drug or treatment is discovered, it has to first be tested on a group of people to know its efficacy and safety. 
	- The process includes an analysis called trial where medications or interventions are tested to know how human bodies react to a particular treatment.

4. Application of Statistics in **Psychology**
	- Statistics can be used to study human behaviour and prediction of thoughts and actions that may take place in future.

5. Application of Statistics in **Corporate Sectors**
	- Almost every small and large business employs a dedicated statistical research division that aims to predict and analyze the companies current and predicted growth
	- Business success relies on identifying what is important and what is vague

6. Application of Statistics in **Weather Forecasting**
	- Weather forecasting on computers is based on a set of statistical functions. 
	- All of these statistics are used to compare the current weather to previously recorded seasons and conditions.

7. Application of Statistics in **Political Campaigns**
	- Statistics aids politicians, or rather, the country’s predicted future leaders, in determining how many chances they have to win an election in a specific location.

8. Application of Statistics in **Financial Markets**
	- Statistics are used to compute all of the stock prices. 
	- It also assists the investor in deciding whether or not to invest in a certain stock.


## 1.2 Importance and scope of Statistics

### 1.2.1 Importance

1. **Use Descriptive Statistics to Understand the World**
	- Statistics is indispensable in planning may it be in business, economics or government level. 
	- The modern age is termed as the ‘age of planning’ and almost all organizations in the government or business or management are resorting to planning for efficient working and for formulating policy decision.
	- To achieve this end, the statistical data relating to production, consumption, birth, death, investment, income are of paramount importance. 
	- Today efficient planning is a must for almost all countries, particularly the developing economies for their economic development.

2. **Statistics in Mathematics**
	- Statistics is intimately related to and essentially dependent upon mathematics. 
	- The modern theory of Statistics has its foundations on the theory of probability which in turn is a particular branch of more advanced mathematical theory of Measures and Integration. 
	- Ever increasing role of mathematics into statistics has led to the development of a new branch of statistics called Mathematical Statistics.
	- Thus Statistics may be considered to be an important member of the mathematics family. 
	- In the words of Connor, “Statistics is a branch of applied mathematics which specializes in data”

3. **Statistics in Economics**
	- Development of modern statistical methods has led to an extensive use of statistics in Economics.
	- All the important branches of Economics—consumption, production, exchange, distribution, public finance—use statistics for the purpose of comparison, presentation, interpretation, etc. 
	- Problem of spending of income on and by different sections of the people, production of national wealth, adjustment of demand and supply, effect of economic policies on the economy etc. 
	- simply indicate the importance of statistics in the field of economics and in its different branches.
	- Statistics of Public Finance enables us to impose tax, to provide subsidy, to spend on various heads, amount of money to be borrowed or lent etc. 
	- So we cannot think of Statistics without Economics or Economics without Statistics.

4. **Statistics in Social Sciences**
	- Every social phenomenon is affected to a marked extent by a multiplicity of factors which bring out the variation in observations from time to time, place to place and object to object. 
	- Statistical tools of Regression and Correlation Analysis can be used to study and isolate the effect of each of these factors on the given observation.
	- Sampling Techniques and Estimation Theory are very powerful and indispensable tools for conducting any social survey, pertaining to any strata of society and then analyzing the results and drawing valid inferences. 
	- The most important application of statistics in sociology is in the field of Demography for studying mortality (death rates), fertility (birth rates), marriages, population growth and so on.

5. **Statistics in Trade**
	- As already mentioned, statistics is a body of methods to make wise decisions in the face of uncertainties. 
	- Business is full of uncertainties and risks. We have to forecast at every step. Speculation is just gaining or losing by way of forecasting. 
	- Can we forecast without taking into view the past? Perhaps, no. 
	- The future trend of the market can only be expected if we make use of statistics. Failure in anticipation will mean failure of business.
	- Changes in demand, supply, habits, fashion etc. can be anticipated with the help of statistics. 
	- Statistics is of utmost significance in determining prices of the various products, determining the phases of boom and depression etc. 
	- Use of statistics helps in smooth running of the business, in reducing the uncertainties and thus contributes towards the success of business.

6. **Statistics in Research Work**
	- The job of a research worker is to present the result of his research before the community. 
	- The effect of a variable on a particular problem, under differing conditions, can be known by the research worker only if he makes use of statistical methods. 
	- Statistics are everywhere basic to research activities. 
	- To keep alive his research interests and research activities, the researcher is required to lean upon his knowledge and skills in statistical methods.

## 1.3 Limitations of statistics

- Statistics is a mathematical science pertaining to the collection, analysis, interpretation or explanation, and presentation of data. 
- Statisticians improve the quality of data with the design of experiments and survey sampling.
1. Statistics does not deal with isolated measurement
2. Statistics deals with only quantitative characteristics
3.  Statistics laws are true on average. Statistics are aggregates of facts. So single observation is not a statistics, it deals with groups and aggregates only.
4. Statistical methods are best applicable on quantitative data.
5. Statistical cannot be applied to heterogeneous data.
6. It sufficient care is not exercised in collecting, analyzing and interpretation the data, statistical results might be misleading.
7. Only a person who has an expert knowledge of statistics can handle statistical data efficiently.
8. Some errors are possible in statistical decisions. Particularly the inferential statistics involves certain errors. We do not know whether an error has been committed or not.

## 1.4 Distrust of Statistics

- By definition, distrust means a lack of confidence or belief. 
- Further, the science of statistics is always subject to doubt and suspicion because of its misuse by unscrupulous elements for their selfish motives. 
- The common beliefs about statistics are:

	-   One ounce of truth can produce tonnes of statistics
	-   Statistics can prove anything
	-   It can prove nothing
	-   Figures don’t lie; cheater make figures up
	-   There are three types of lies – lies, damn lies, and statistics
	-   Numbers, though accurate, are open to manipulation by selfish people to conceal the truth and present a distorted picture of the facts.

- Therefore, it is important to understand that statistics is a tool, which if misused can cause a disaster. 
- Statistics neither approves or disapproves anything. 
- Hence, you must take utmost care and precaution while interpreting statistical data in all manifestations.

## 1.5 Statistical Data Collection

- In Statistics, data collection is a process of gathering information from all the relevant sources to find a solution to the research problem. 
- It helps to evaluate the outcome of the problem. 
- The data collection methods allow a person to conclude an answer to the relevant question. 
- Most of the organizations use data collection methods to make assumptions about future probabilities and trends. 
- Once the data is collected, it is necessary to undergo the data organization process.
- The main sources of the data collections methods are “Data”. 
- Data can be classified into two types, namely primary data and secondary data. 
- The primary importance of data collection in any research or business process is that it helps to determine many important things about the company, particularly the performance. 
- So, the data collection process plays an important role in all the streams. 
- Depending on the type of data, the data collection method is divided into two categories namely,

1. Primary Data Collection methods
2. Secondary Data Collection methods

### 1.5.1 Primary data

- Primary data or raw data is a type of information that is obtained directly from the first-hand source through experiments, surveys or observations. 
- The primary data collection method is further classified into two types. They are

-   Quantitative Data Collection Methods
-   Qualitative Data Collection Methods

##### Quantitative Data Collection Methods

- It is based on mathematical calculations using various formats like close-ended questions, correlation and regression methods, mean, median or mode measures. 
- This method is cheaper than qualitative data collection methods and it can be applied in a short duration of time.

**1. Time Series Analysis**

‘Time series’ is a sequential order of values at equal time intervals. Patterns are used to identify trends, which help organizations predict the demand for products and services for a given period of time.

**2. Smoothing Techniques**

Smoothing techniques come in handy where time trends lack significance as they eliminate random variations from historical data. This exposes patterns and estimates future demand. Simple and weighted moving average methods are commonly used for such forecasting techniques.

**3. Barometric Method**  

In this method, researchers adopt a leading indicators approach to use current developments and utilize them to speculate future trends. Past events are considered leading indicators if they’re capable of predicting future events.

##### Qualitative Data Collection Methods

- It does not involve any mathematical calculations. 
- This method is closely associated with elements that are not quantifiable. 
- This qualitative data collection method includes interviews, questionnaires, observations, case studies, etc. 
- There are several methods to collect this type of data. They are

1. **Observation Method**

- Observation method is used when the study relates to behavioural science. 
- This method is planned systematically. 
- It is subject to many controls and checks. 
- The different types of observations are:

	-   Structured and unstructured observation
	-   Controlled and uncontrolled observation
	-   Participant, non-participant and disguised observation

2. **Interview Method**

- The method of collecting data in terms of verbal responses. 
- It is achieved in two ways, such as

	-   Personal Interview – In this method, a person known as an interviewer is required to ask questions face to face to the other person. The personal interview can be structured or unstructured, direct investigation, focused conversation, etc.
	-   Telephonic Interview – In this method, an interviewer obtains information by contacting people on the telephone to ask the questions or views, verbally.

3. **Questionnaire Method**

- In this method, the set of questions are mailed to the respondent. 
- They should read, reply and subsequently return the questionnaire. 
- The questions are printed in the definite order on the form. 
- A good survey should have the following features:

	-   Short and simple
	-   Should follow a logical sequence
	-   Provide adequate space for answers
	-   Avoid technical terms
	-   Should have good physical appearance such as colour, quality of the paper to attract the attention of the respondent

4. **Schedules**

- This method is similar to the questionnaire method with a slight difference. 
- The enumerations are specially appointed for the purpose of filling the schedules. 
- It explains the aims and objects of the investigation and may remove misunderstandings, if any have come up. 
- Enumerators should be trained to perform their job with hard work and patience.

##### **Advantages Of Primary Data Collection Methods**  

1.   Whether it’s product features or employee productivity, collecting primary data allows businesses to address specific issues that they want to deal with 
2.  Compared to secondary data, primary data is far more accurate because secondary data isn’t regulated and there’s a risk of collecting false information 
3.   Primary data is the property of the researcher who may or may not choose to share it. This means that businesses can keep information from being accessed by competitors. They may even decide to sell crucial data to rivals in the future at very high prices 
4.   The information from primary sources is updated as data is collected in real-time 
5.   Primary data collection methods let researchers control research design and the methods they use

##### **Disadvantages Of Primary Data Collection Methods**  

1.  This is an expensive process of data collection, irrespective of the size of the research. It involves appointing trained professionals and may need sophisticated, expensive methods.  
2.  Data has to be collected from the root, which makes it a time-consuming affair. Researchers have to spend significant time collecting and processing data.
3.  Primary research may require huge volumes of data and the research demand may seem unrealistic. For instance, it’s not feasible to do a census of people in a community to outline the target market.

### 1.5.2 Secondary Data

- Secondary data is data collected by someone other than the actual user. 
- It means that the information is already available, and someone analyses it. 
- The secondary data includes magazines, newspapers, books, journals, etc. 
- It may be either published data or unpublished data.

##### Published data are available in various resources including

- **Collecting Information Available On The Internet** 
 
	- One of the most popular methods of collecting secondary data is by using the internet. 
	- Readily available data can be accessed with the click of a button, which makes the internet one of the best places where secondary data can be collected from. 
	- It’s practically free of cost, although some websites may charge money—usually low prices. 
	- However, organizations and individuals must look out for inauthentic and untrustworthy sources of information.

- **Collecting Data Available In Government And Non-Government Agencies** 

	- Government and non-government agencies such as Census bureaus, government printing offices and business development centers store relevant data and valuable information that both individuals and organizations can access.

- **Accessing Public Libraries** 

	- Public libraries house copies of research, public documents and statistical information. 
	- Although services may vary, libraries usually have a vast collection of publications highlighting market statistics, business directories and newsletters. 
 
- **Using Data From Educational Institutions**

	- Educational institutions are often overlooked when deciding a method of collection. 
	- Educational institutions conduct more research than any other sector. 
	- Universities have a plethora of primary data that can act as vital information for secondary research.

- **Using Sources Of Commercial Information** 
    
	- Commercial information sources like television, newspapers, radio or magazines are a great source of first-hand information on market research, economic developments, political agenda and demographic segmentation. 

##### Unpublished data includes

-   Diaries
-   Letters
-   Unpublished biographies, etc.

##### Advantages of Secondary Data

1.  The process is less expensive compared to the primary method. There’s minimum expenditure associated with obtaining data from authentic sources.   
2.  Data collected for secondary research can give a fair idea about how effective the primary research was. Businesses can hypothesize and evaluate the cost of primary research.   
3.  Re-evaluating data from another person’s point of view can uncover things that may have been overlooked. This may lead to discovering new features or fixing a bug in an app.   
4.  Secondary data collection is less time-consuming as the data doesn’t need to be collected from the root. Hence, data collection time is significantly lower than primary methods.   

##### **Disadvantages Of Secondary Data Collection Methods**  

1.   Data may be readily available but the credibility of sources is under constant scrutiny. Research can break down due to a lack of credible and authentic information
2.   Most secondary data sources don’t offer the latest statistics, studies or reports. Accurate data doesn’t necessarily mean updated data
3.  As a researcher has no control over the primary source or quality of information, the success of secondary research heavily depends on the quality of the primary research that was conducted


## 1.6 Presentation of statistical Data

- Data is made up of raw numbers, typically with many variables. 
- These numbers often come from research that was conducted as part of a study or survey and are a primary source.  
- Data is often in the form of a digital data set. 
- Data is capable of being analyzed using statistical procedures. 
- Data is used to create new information or knowledge. 
- For example, census data provides data about the number of people within a particular area with variables such as gender, age, income, etc.

### 1.6.1 Classification of Data 

![Classification of data](https://github.com/anilkaraniya/college/blob/main/BCA/sem-1/notes/Statistic/stats-assets/imp_1_classification_of_data.png?raw=true)

1. Geographical Classification
	- The classification of data on the basis of geographical location or region is known as **Geographical** or **Spatial Classification**. 
	- For example, presenting the population of different states of a country is done on the basis of geographical location or region.

2. Chronological Classification
	- The classification of data with respect to different time periods is known as **Chronological** or **Temporal Classification**. 
	- For example, the number of students in a school in different years can be presented on the basis of a time period.

3. Qualitative Classification
	- The classification of data on the basis of descriptive or qualitative characteristics like region, caste, sex, gender, education, etc., is known as **Qualitative Classification.** 
	- A qualitative classification can not be quantified and can be of two types; viz., **Simple Classification** and **Manifold Classification.** 
	 **Simple Classification**
		- When based on only one attribute, the given data is classified into two classes, which is known as **Simple Classification**.
		- For example, when the population is divided into literate and illiterate, it is a simple classification.
		![simple classification](https://github.com/anilkaraniya/college/blob/main/BCA/Statistic/stats-assets/imp_2_simple_classification.png?raw=true)
	**Manifold Classification**
		- When based on more than one attribute, the given data is classified into different classes, and then sub-divided into more sub-classes, which is known as **Manifold Classification.** 
		- For example, when the population is divided into literate and illiterate, then sub-divided into male and female, and further sub-divided into married and unmarried, it is a manifold classification.
		![Manifold Classification](https://github.com/anilkaraniya/college/blob/main/BCA/Statistic/stats-assets/imp_3_Manifold_Classification.png?raw=true)

1. Quantitative Classification
	- The classification of data on the basis of the characteristics, such as age, height, weight, income, etc., that can be measured in quantity is known as **Quantitative Classification**. 
	- For example, the weight of students in a class can be classified as quantitative classification.


### 1.6.2 Tabulation

- Tabulation is a systematic and logical representation of numeric data in rows and columns to facilitate comparison and statistical analysis. 
- It facilitates comparison by bringing related information close to each other and helps in statistical analysis and interpretation.
- In other words, the method of placing organised data into a tabular form is known as tabulation. 
- It may be complex, double, or simple, depending upon the nature of categorisation.
- **Objectives Of Tabulation**:

**(1) To simplify complex data**
-   It reduces the bulk of information, i.e., it reduces raw data in a simplified and meaningful form so that it can be easily interpreted by a common man in less time.

**(2) To bring out essential features of data**
-   It brings out the chief/main characteristics of data.
-   It presents facts clearly and precisely without textual explanation.

**(3) To facilitate comparison**
-   The representation of data in rows and columns is helpful in simultaneous detailed comparison on the basis of several parameters.

**(4) To facilitate statistical analysis**
-   Tables serve as the best source of organised data for statistical analysis.
-   The task of computing average, dispersion, correlation, etc., becomes easier if data is presented in the form of a table.

**(5) To save space**
-   A table presents facts in a better way than the textual form.
-   It saves space without sacrificing the quality and quantity of data.

### 1.6.3 Frequency Distribution

#### 1.6.3.1 Introduction
- **Frequency distributions** can show either the actual number of observations falling in each range or the percentage of observations. 
- In the latter instance, the distribution is called a **relative frequency distribution**.
- Frequency distribution tables can be used for both categorical and numeric variables. 
- Continuous variables should only be used with class intervals, which will be explained shortly.

#### 1.6.3.2 Class Intervals

- If a variable takes a large number of values, then it is easier to present and handle the data by grouping the values into class intervals. 
- Continuous variables are more likely to be presented in class intervals, while discrete variables can be grouped into class intervals or not.
- **Class interval width** is the difference between the lower endpoint of an interval and the lower endpoint of the next interval. 
- Thus, if our study's continuous intervals are 0 to 4, 5 to 9, etc., the width of the first five intervals is 5, and the last interval is open, since no higher endpoint is assigned to it.

**Rules for data sets that contain a large number of observations**

1. find the lowest and highest values of the variables
2. decide on the width of the class intervals
3.  include all possible values of the variable.

- In deciding on the width of the class intervals, you will have to find a compromise between having intervals short enough so that not all of the observations fall in the same interval, but long enough so that you do not end up with only one observation per interval.
- It is also important to make sure that the class intervals are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive.

**Frequency distribution can be visualized using:**

-   a **pie chart (**nominal variable),
-   a **bar chart** (nominal or ordinal variable),
-   a **line chart** (ordinal or discrete variable),
-   or **a histogram** (continuous variable).

### 1.6.4 Diagrams and Graphs.

- Statistics involves the collection of data from multiple quantities for the purpose of analysis and finding information. 
- The data that is being collected can be represented with charts and diagrams.
- From the charts and diagrams, you will be able to make an analysis and possibly predict future outcomes.
- Following are some of the graphs:- 

**1. Bar chart**
- Bar charts are used to compare data. 
- The data is organized in categories in form of rectangular bars on a graph and from there you can compare different categories of data.
- The rectangular bars are usually of different heights and they can be represented horizontally or vertically.
 - Uses of bar charts
	1.  A bar chart is used to visually display and analyze data.
	2.  It is used to compare data in categories.
	3.  It is used for illustration purposes.

**2. Pie chart**
- This chart is called a pie chart because it is circular and it is sectioned in a way that it looks like slices of a pie. 
- The pie chart represents data that is split into different categories. The categories are the slices of the pie.
- Uses of Pie chart
	1.  A pie chart is used to split complex data into smaller and simpler categories.
	2.  It is used to show the proportion of categories of data.

**3. Histogram**
- Just like the bar chart, the data in a histogram chart is represented with bars but a histogram organizes data in ranges. 
- It shows the frequency at which different ranges of data occur.
- Uses of a histogram
	1.  Display data in categories and ranges.
	2.  Find the frequency of an event.
	3.  Organize and summarize a large set of data.

**4. Line chart**
- A line chart is also called, a line plot or line graph. 
- It is used to show how variables and information change over time. 
- The information on a line chart is represented with points and the points are connected with a continuous line.
- Uses of a Line chart
	1.  See how data changes over time.
	2.  Track the trend of an occurrence.
	3.  Show and compare change over time.

**5. Flow chart**
- A flow chart is a process diagram. 
- It shows the steps to follow for a particular process and also makes the steps easier to follow. If the procedure is a complex one, it can be made simpler with a flowchart.
- Uses of a flow chart
	1.  Show the process of a system.
	2.  Study the process of a system.
	3.  Document the process of a system.
	4.  Communicate clearly how a system works.
