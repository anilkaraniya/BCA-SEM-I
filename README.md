# You might FAIL Ur Exams!!

>"Well not talking about the college exams but as long as you rely on the 100 or thousand pg book then ur nothing but an HR in a Call Center."

*-no offense if taken then it is a truth if not then ur a fool*

These are the notes I made during my first year with no reference to go with and no experience of the KKUS examinations. This material is totally my view on the subjects at hand. You might have your own material or have more guidance from us Seniors which makes more sense Then for sure go with those.

In earnest I made these notes and studied them and passed with some pretty good grades. But keep in mind my programming experience played a major role.

All the Very Best! and hope you give it ur best.
