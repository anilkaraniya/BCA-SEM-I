## 2.1 Measures of Central Tendency

### 2.1.1 Introduction

- A measure of central tendency (also referred to as measures of centre or central location) is a summary measure that attempts to describe a whole set of data with a single value that represents the middle or centre of its distribution.
- There are three main measures of central tendency:

	-   mode
	-   median
	-   mean

#### 1. Mode

- The mode is the most commonly occurring value in a distribution.

**Advantage of the mode**
- The mode has an advantage over the median and the mean as it can be found for both numerical and categorical (non-numerical) data.

**Limitations of the mode**
- It is also possible for there to be more than one mode for the same distribution of data, (bi-modal, or multi-modal).  
- The presence of more than one mode can limit the ability of the mode in describing the centre or typical value of the distribution because a single value to describe the centre cannot be identified.
- In some cases, particularly where the data are continuous, the distribution may have no mode at all (i.e.  if all values are different).

#### 2. median

- The median is the middle value in distribution when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order.
- The median divides the distribution in half (there are 50% of observations on either side of the median value). 
- In a distribution with an odd number of observations, the median value is the middle value.

**Advantage of the median**
- The median is less affected by outliers and skewed data than the mean and is usually the preferred measure of central tendency when the distribution is not symmetrical.  

**Limitation of the median**
- The median cannot be identified for categorical nominal data, as it cannot be logically ordered.

#### 3. Mean

- The mean is the sum of the value of each observation in a dataset divided by the number of observations. This is also known as the arithmetic average.
- The mean is calculated by adding together all the values and dividing by the number of observations

**Advantage of the mean**
- The mean can be used for both continuous and discrete numeric data.

**Limitations of the mean**
- The mean cannot be calculated for categorical data, as the values cannot be summed.
- As the mean includes every value in the distribution the mean is influenced by outliers and skewed distributions.

**Another thing about the mean**
- The population mean is indicated by the Greek symbol µ (pronounced ‘mu’).  
- When the mean is calculated on a distribution from a sample it is indicated by the symbol x̅  (pronounced X-bar).


### 2.1.2 Frequency distribution

- A frequency distribution is a comprehensive way to organize raw data of a quantitative variable. 
- It shows how different values of a variable are distributed and their corresponding frequencies. However, we can prepare two frequency distribution tables, namely discrete frequency distribution and continuous frequency distribution table.

### 2.1.2 Discrete Frequency Distribution

- Let the given data consist of n distinct values x1, x2, …, xn occurring with frequencies f1, f2, …, fn, respectively. 
- Then, this data can be represented in the tabular form with variables and the corresponding frequencies as given below and is called discrete frequency distribution:
- Thus, in a discrete frequency distribution, the values of the variable are determined individually. 
- The number of times each value occurs denotes the frequencies of the particular value or observation. 
- Discrete frequency distribution is also known as ungrouped frequency distribution.

### 2.1.3 Continuous Frequency Distribution

- A frequency distribution is a comprehensive way to organize raw data of a quantitative variable. There are two types of frequency distribution tables. They are discrete frequency distribution and continuous frequency distribution.

### 2.1.4 Graphic Representation of a Frequency Distribution

- Graphical representation can be used for both the educated section and uneducated section of the society. Furthermore, any hidden trend present in the given data can be noticed only in this mode of representation.

1.  Line diagram
2.  Histogram
3.  Bar diagram
4.  Pie chart
5.  Frequency polygon
6.  Ogives or Cumulative frequency graphs

**1.Line diagram**
- When the time series exhibit a wide range of fluctuations, we may think of logarithmic or ratio chart where “Log y” and not “y” is plotted against “t”.

![line-graph-2](https://i0.wp.com/theintactone.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/line-graph-2.jpg?resize=568%2C395&ssl=1)

- We use Multiple line chart for representing two or more related time series data expressed in the same unit and multiple – axis chart in somewhat similar situations, if the variables are expressed in different units.

2.  **Histogram**

- A two dimensional graphical representation of a continuous frequency distribution is called a histogram.

![histogram.png](https://i0.wp.com/theintactone.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/histogram.png?resize=220%2C220&ssl=1)

- In histogram, the bars are placed continuously side by side with no gap between adjacent bars.
- That is, in histogram rectangles are erected on the class intervals of the distribution. The areas of rectangle are proportional to the frequencies.

3.  **Bar diagram**

- There are two types of bar diagrams namely, Horizontal Bar diagram and Vertical bar diagram.

![simplebarchart.jpg](https://i0.wp.com/theintactone.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/simplebarchart.jpg?resize=488%2C280&ssl=1)

- While horizontal bar diagram is used for qualitative data or data varying over space, the vertical bar diagram is associated with quantitative data or time series data.
- Bars i.e. rectangles of equal width and usually of varying lengths are drawn either horizontally or vertically.
- We consider Multiple or Grouped Bar diagrams to compare related series. Component or sub-divided Bar diagrams are applied for representing data divided into a number of components. Finally, we use Divided Bar charts or Percentage
- Bar diagrams for comparing different components of a variable and also the relating of the components to the whole. For this situation, we may also use Pie chart or Pie diagram or circle diagram.

4.  **Pie chart**

- In a pie chart, the various observations or components are represented by the sectors of a circle and the whole circle represents the sum of the value of all the components .Clearly, the total angle of 360° at the center of the circle is divided according to the values of the components .
- The central angle of a component is =  \[ Value of the component  /  Total value] x 360°
- Sometimes, the value of the components are expressed in percentages. In such cases,
- The central angle of a component is =  \[ Percentage value of the component  /  100 ] x 360°

5.  **Frequency polygon**

- Frequency Polygon is another method of representing frequency distribution graphically.
- Obtain the frequency distribution and compute the mid points of each class interval.
- Represent the mid points along the X-axis and the frequencies along the Y-axis.
- Plot the points corresponding to the frequency at each mid point.
- Join these points, by straight lines in order.
- To complete the polygon join the point at each end immediately to the lower or higher class marks (as the case may be at zero frequency) on the X-axis.

6.  **Ogives or Cumulative frequency graphs**

By plotting cumulative frequency against the respective class boundary, we get ogives.

- As such there are two ogives – less than type ogives, obtained by taking less than cumulative frequency on the vertical axis and more than type ogives by plotting more than type cumulative frequency on the vertical axis and thereafter joining the plotted points successively by line segments.

## 2.2 Average or Measures of Central Tendency or Measures of Locations

## 2.2.1 Requisites for an ideal Measure of Central Tendency

- According to Professor Yule, the following are the characteristics to be satisfied by an ideal measure of central tendency:

i) It should be rigidly defined

ii) It should be readily comprehensible and easy to calculate

iii) It should be based upon all the observations

iv) It should be suitable for further mathematical treatment. By this we mean that if we are given the averages and sizes of a number of series, we should be able to calculate the average of the composite series obtained on combining the given series.

v) It should be affected as little as possible by fluctuations of sampling.

- In addition to the above criteria, we may add the following (which is not due to Prof. Yule):

vi) It should not be affected much by extreme values

### 2.2.2 Arithmetic: Mean Median, Mode

#### Arithmetic Mean

- In statistics, the **Arithmetic Mean (AM)** or called average is the ratio of the sum of all observations to the total number of observations. 
- The arithmetic mean can also inform or model concepts outside of statistics.
- Arithmetic mean represents a number that is obtained by dividing the sum of the elements of a set by the number of values in the set. 
- So you can use the layman term Average, or be a little bit fancier and use the word “Arithmetic mean” your call, take your pick -they both mean the same. 
- The arithmetic mean may be either

-   Simple Arithmetic Mean
-   Weighted Arithmetic Mean

##### Arithmetic Mean Formula

- If any data set consisting of the values b1, b2, b3, …., bn  then the arithmetic mean B is defined as:
B = (Sum of all observations)/ (Total number of observation)

![Arithmetic Mean](https://d138zd1ktt9iqe.cloudfront.net/media/seo_landing_files/arithmetic-mean-formulas-1623244335.png)

#### Arithmetic Median
- Arithmetic Median is a positional average and refers to the middle value in a distribution. It divides the series into two halves by first arranging the items in ascending or descending order of magnitude and then locating the middle value

#### Arithmetic Mode

- Arithmetic Mode refers to the most frequently occurring value in the data set. In other words, modal value has the highest frequency associated with it

### 2.2.3 Geometric Mean

- **Geometric Mean (GM)** is the average value or mean which signifies the central tendency of the set of numbers by finding the product of their values. 
- Basically, we multiply the numbers altogether and take the nth root of the multiplied numbers, where n is the total number of data values.
- the geometric mean is defined as the nth root of the product of n numbers. It is noted that the geometric mean is different from the arithmetic mean. 
- Because, in arithmetic mean, we add the data values and then divide it by the total number of values. 
- But in geometric mean, we multiply the given data values and then take the root with the radical index for the total number of data values.

##### Geometric Mean Formula

### 2.2.4 Harmonic mean

- The harmonic mean is a measure of central tendency. 
- Say we want to determine a single value that can be used the describe the behavior of data around a central value. 
- Then such a value is known as a measure of central tendency. 
- In statistics, there are three measures of central tendency.
- The **harmonic mean** is a type of Pythagorean mean. 
- To find it, we divide the number of terms in a data series by the sum of all the reciprocal terms. 
- It will always be the lowest as compared to the geometric and arithmetic mean.

##### Harmonic Mean Formula

### 2.3 Weighted Average

- When some quantities are more important than the others and do not contribute equally to the final result thus multiplying them to a coefficient is called weighted average. 
- It is a simple process of deriving at an average value between two or quantities when weight is added to it.

#### Weighted Average Formula

![Weighted Average](https://d138zd1ktt9iqe.cloudfront.net/media/seo_landing_files/weighted-average-formula-1623870358.png)

### Real-Life Examples on Weighted Average

A customer's decision to buy or not to buy a product depends on the quality of the product, knowledge of the product, cost of the product, and service by the franchise. Further, the customer assigns weight to each of these criteria and calculates the weighted average. This will help him in making the best decision while buying the product.

![Example on Weighted Average](https://d138zd1ktt9iqe.cloudfront.net/media/seo_landing_files/weighted-average-02-1639145080.png)

For appointing a person for a job, the interviewer looks at his personality, working capabilities, educational qualification, and team working skills. Based on the job profile, these criteria are given different levels of importance(weights) and then the final selection is done.

![Example on Weighted Average](https://d138zd1ktt9iqe.cloudfront.net/media/seo_landing_files/weighted-average-03-1639145140.png)

**Example:** The below table presents the weights of different decision features of an automobile. With the help of this information, we need to calculate the weighted average.

## 2.3 Relationship amongst different Averages

- Relationship between Mean Median and Mode is known as the “Empirical Relationship”.
- The relationship between mean median and mode can be expressed by using Karl Pearson’s Formula as:

> (Mean - Median) = ⅓ (Mean - Mode)
>
>3 (Mean - Median) = (Mean - Mode)
>
>Mode = Mean - 3(Mean - Median)
>
>Mode = 3 Median - 2 Mean

- Thus, the above equation can be used when any of the two values are given and you need to find the third value.

Example :-  In a moderately skewed distribution, the median is 20 and the mean is 22.5. Using these values, find the approximate value of the mode.

**Solution:**

Given,
Mean = 22.5
Median = 20
Mode = x
Now, using the relationship between mean mode and median we get,

(Mean – Mode) = 3 (Mean – Median)

So,
22.5 – x = 3 (22.5 – 20)
22.5 – x = 7.5
∴ x = 15
**So, Mode = 15.**
